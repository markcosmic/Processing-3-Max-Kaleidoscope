# Processing-3-Max-Kaleidoscope
A major alteration to Daniel Shiffman's Kaleidoscope Snowflake. His video can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3C2giDfmO8&amp;t=1s
What I added to this sketch:
Rotated to sketch 90 degrees(more visually pleasing).
The ability to save the created design with either a black background or a transparent background.
Up to 60 symmetries.
Color or snowflake mode.(snowflake mode defaults to 6 symmetry).
Undo single last drawn right mouse drag to mouse release(plan to create an undo array).
TODO: erase. Here is where I had problems. I could erase to black but that shows up in saving transparent. So trying to erase to transparent.
